## 🧠 Approach

### 📂 Data Loading & Preprocessing

* Loads ball-by-ball IPL data
* Handles missing or invalid data
* Creates feature vectors like overs, wickets lost, and current run rate

### 🤖 Modeling

* Uses regression techniques (e.g. RandomForest, XGBoost)
* Trains the model on historical IPL matches
* Generates predictions for new innings

### 📈 Evaluation

* Evaluates performance using RMSE and R²
* Provides plots to visualize errors and model predictions
